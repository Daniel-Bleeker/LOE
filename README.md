# Half-Baked Economic Analysis/Philosophizing
This repository contains random writings I have done mainly focusing on economics. This repository is really just for fun, I am no acedemic or scholar. I, just like everyone else, really like hearing myself talk and think others should spend more time listening to me talk too. So I created this repository were I ramble unintelligably about erronious stuff in economics so others can do so.
